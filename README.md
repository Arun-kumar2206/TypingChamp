# TypingChamp

TypingChamp is a web-based typing speed test application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy by providing a random text snippet.

## Features

- Fetches random text snippets (limited to around 15 words) from an API.
- Tracks typing speed (words per minute).
- Calculates accuracy based on typed words.
- Real-time feedback while typing.

## Demo

You can check out the live demo of the project [here](https://arun-kumar2206.github.io/TypingChamp/).

## Technologies Used

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, the app fetches a random text snippet from an API.
2. Users type the given text in the input area.
3. The app calculates and displays the typing speed (WPM) and accuracy in real-time.
